# Changelog

## 2.0.0 — 2026-04-06

Phase 2: Governed Action Receipt, MCP hardening, Cedar integration, institutional repo, human invariants.

### Added

- **Governed Action Receipt** (`lib/receipt.mjs`, `bin/zlar-verify`, `bin/zlar-receipt`, `etc/receipt.schema.json`). Portable cryptographic proof that a governed action was evaluated by deterministic policy and decided by the appropriate authority. Cross-gate compatible — bash-generated receipts verify with Node and vice versa. Receipt schema v0.1.0.
- **Receipt integration** in both gates. Bash gate: `_emit_receipt()` alongside `emit_event` when `ZLAR_EMIT_RECEIPTS=true`. MCP gate: receipt generation on every governed action when signing key available.
- **Per-entry audit signing (MCP gate)**. Every MCP gate audit event is now Ed25519-signed. Matches bash gate approach: canonical JSON, SHA-256 hex, Ed25519 sign hex bytes, base64. Cross-gate compatible.
- **Policy signature verification (MCP gate)**. `verifyJsonSignature()` closes the Phase B TODO. Invalid or tampered policy = deny-all (fail-closed).
- **Standing approval support (MCP gate)**. `checkStandingApproval()` — same format and matching as bash gate, signature-verified. Checked before Telegram escalation.
- **Fail-closed hardening (MCP gate)**. Default switch case: deny (was passthrough). Upstream error: deny to client. Uncaught exception handler: audit + exit. Unknown policy action: deny.
- **Cedar policy evaluation** (`lib/cedar-evaluator.mjs`). Production WASM evaluator with policy ID mapping. Priority 1 rules (R002, R003, R005, R006, R007) and Priority 2 rules (R014, R016) translated to Cedar. Standing approval equivalents as Cedar permits. MCP gate: `--policy-engine json|cedar|both`.
- **Human invariant enforcement** (`lib/human-invariants.sh`, `lib/human-invariants.mjs`). Five mechanical enforcements wired into both gates: H6 (decision cap, 80/day), H13 (pending queue capacity), H14 (approval rate monitoring), H15 (deliberation floor: critical 30s, warn 10s, info 3s), H17 (human authenticity, reject sub-second responses).
- **Architecture Decision Records** (`docs/adr/ADR-001` through `ADR-006`). Deterministic enforcement, bash implementation, fail-closed, Ed25519, manifest narrows policy, structural independence.
- **GOVERNANCE.md**. Decision-making process, ADR index, invariant amendment procedure.
- **ADOPTERS.md**. Template for production and evaluation users.
- **GitHub templates**. Issue templates (bug, feature, security), PR template with invariant checklist.
- **Quickstart script** (`scripts/quickstart.sh`). Keygen, deny, receipt, verify in under 60 seconds.
- **Cedar migration guide** (`docs/cedar-migration.md`). JSON-to-Cedar translation, dual-engine mode, known limitations.
- **65 Cedar tests** (`mcp-gate/test-cedar.mjs`). P1/P2 rules, gate action mapping, receipt integration, cross-engine regression.
- **54 MCP hardened tests** (`mcp-gate/test-hardened.mjs`). Policy verification, signing, fail-closed, standing approvals, hash chain integrity.
- **124 receipt tests** (`mcp-gate/test-receipt.mjs`, `tests/test-receipt.sh`). Generation, verification, delegation chains, tampering, cross-gate compatibility.
- **21 human invariant tests** (`tests/test-human-invariants.sh`). Decision cap, deliberation floor, approval rate, capacity, authenticity.

### Changed

- **README.md** rewritten. Category definition, What Is / What Is Not, receipt showcase, ADR table, human invariant layer in architecture.
- **SECURITY.md** expanded. Threat model, supply chain, crypto choices, human invariant protections.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** expanded. Per-area test instructions, adding rules/adapters, PR process, ADR guidance.
- **MCP gate EXPERIMENTAL warning removed.** The gate passes 200+ tests, signs every entry, verifies policy signatures, and fails closed on every error path.

### Test counts

470+ assertions across 15 test suites (10 bash + 5 Node.js).

## 1.7.0 — 2026-04-02

Agent identity, coordination, and Level 2 gate integration.

### Added

- **Agent identity layer** (`lib/agent-identity.sh`). Risk tier classification (critical/high/medium/low), authorization levels (pre-approved/human-review-required/blocked), test agent filtering, pattern detection. Shared by registry, export, and status tools.
- **Agent registry export** (`bin/zlar-agents-export`). Generates signable agent inventory from the cryptographic audit trail. Two views: raw (every agent including test/simulation) and production (filtered). The audit trail IS the registry.
- **Agent binding CLI** (`bin/zlar-agents`). Per-agent policy overlays: standing approval scoping, velocity limits, aggregate budgets, delegation depth limits. `bind`, `unbind`, `show`, `list`, `inventory` commands.
- **Governance dashboard** (`bin/zlar-status`). Single-command health view: gate status, policy state, agent inventory (risk-tiered), recent approvals and denials. `--json` for machine consumption.
- **Delegation chain governance** (Build A). Gate records parent-child ancestry on SubagentStart. Enforces `max_depth`. Standing approvals scope by depth via `depth_rules` in bindings. Monotonic narrowing validation: deeper depths cannot widen permissions. Cycle-safe ancestry traversal (10-hop iteration limit).
- **Aggregate action budgets** (Build B). Per-agent, per-rule budget counters with daily/hourly windows. Counters persist across sessions (`var/sessions/budgets/`). Budget exceeded triggers `respond_deny` + audit event. Trading-style position limits — individual actions pass, aggregate triggers escalation.
- **Policy version sync** (Build C). Gate checks bindings `policy_version` against loaded policy after `load_policy()`. Drift events emit to audit trail. Checks all binding versions, not just first.
- **Per-agent standing approval scoping**. Gate reads `agent-policy-bindings.json` and filters standing approvals by agent_id. Unbound agents get all SAs (backward compatible).
- **Agent identity from hook payload**. Gate extracts `agent_id` from PreToolUse input (was hardcoded `"claude-code"`). Falls back to default for main thread.
- **35 new tests** (`tests/test-agent-identity.sh`). Risk tiers, authorization levels, test agent detection, export views, binding roundtrip, schema validation.

### Fixed

- **R012 policy action**: changed from `deny` (silent block) to `ask` (human decides via Telegram). Silent blocks with no Telegram routing is not human-in-the-loop governance.
- **Gate crash on startup**: `log()` called before function defined at module load time. macOS bash found `/usr/bin/log` (system command) instead. Fixed with direct file logging for pre-function code.
- **`local` at top level**: `local _narrowing_ok` used outside a function. bash error under `set -e` triggered ERR trap crash.
- **OpenSSL resolution**: `crypto.sh` now resolves Homebrew OpenSSL 3.x on macOS (LibreSSL lacks Ed25519 `pkeyutl -rawin`).

### Design principles

- Level 2 coordination imports existing patterns, not invention: RBAC inheritance (delegation chains), trading position limits (aggregate budgets), distributed config management (policy sync).
- Design judged by faithful import of right lessons from RBAC, trading controls, distributed config, and delegated auth.
- The registry is not a database. It is the audit trail viewed from the agent dimension.

### Tests

- 9 bash test suites: 266 assertions
- 4 Node.js test suites (Cedar, MCP, SDK): 93+ assertions
- Grand total: 395+

## 2.0.0-alpha.2 — 2026-03-29

HTTP Hook Adapter — the first connector. Claude Code governance bridge.

### Added

- **HTTP Hook Adapter** (`sdk/hook-adapter/server.mjs`, `bin/zlar-hook-server`). Translates between Claude Code's HTTP hook protocol and the ZLAR gate daemon. Any Claude Code deployment can use ZLAR governance by adding one JSON entry to settings.json — zero agent code changes. `POST /hook` evaluates tool calls against signed Cedar policy. `GET /health` for monitoring.
- **Fail-closed at HTTP level.** Claude Code treats non-2xx as fail-open (tool proceeds). The adapter always returns HTTP 200 with a valid JSON body. JSON parse errors, missing tool names, daemon unreachable, unhandled exceptions — all produce `200 + deny`. Never returns 4xx/5xx for hook evaluations.
- **SubagentStart support.** Maps SubagentStart hook events to the daemon's agent domain evaluation. Claude Code's SubagentStart hooks route through the same governance pipeline as PreToolUse.
- **Managed settings generator** (`sdk/hook-adapter/managed-settings.mjs`). Generates enterprise `managed-settings.json` with two-layer defense: static deny rules (fail-closed floor for most dangerous operations) + HTTP hook (dynamic Cedar policy evaluation). `allowManagedHooksOnly: true` prevents governance bypass. Deploy via MDM to `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`.
- **19 new tests.** Unit tests (daemon unavailable, managed settings generation), integration tests (allow, deny, SubagentStart, malformed input, chain forwarding, error handling). Every test verifies the HTTP 200 invariant.

### Architecture note

This is the first Phase 2 connector — the bridge from "governance membrane exists" to "anyone can use it." An enterprise deploys ZLAR by: (1) running `zlar-daemon`, (2) running `zlar-hook-server`, (3) dropping managed-settings.json. No agent code changes. The bash gate remains the local enforcement surface; the hook adapter is the remote/enterprise surface.

## 2.0.0-alpha.1 — 2026-03-29

Phase 2 security hardening pass. Four structural gaps fixed from multi-agent review.

### Fixed

- **Chain verification at daemon boundary.** `handleEvaluate()` now calls `verifyChain()` before any policy evaluation. Walks the full chain: structural checks, sequential depth fields, `parent_jti` links, and Ed25519 signature verification (root against daemon key, each child against parent key). Fail-closed: invalid or unverifiable chain → immediate deny with `rule: chain:verify`. Previously, chain depth was computed as `chain.length - 1` on an attacker-supplied array with no cryptographic verification — audit `chain_depth` and policy depth enforcement were unverified attacker-controlled data.
- **Canonical form: raw SHA-256 bytes.** `signToken()` and `verifyTokenSig()` in `chain.mjs`, and the equivalent in `daemon.mjs`, now sign and verify `SHA-256(canonical).digest()` (raw bytes) rather than `SHA-256(canonical).digest('hex')` (the ASCII hex string of the hash). The previous form signed a 64-byte ASCII string rather than the 32-byte hash digest — any external verifier replicating the signing would need to know about this double-encoding. All token signatures regenerate on first use.
- **Telegram inbox path configurable.** Hardcoded `/var/run/zlar-tg/inbox/cc` is now sourced from `cfg.telegramInboxDir`, which reads from `gate.json` `telegram.inbox_dir` with the previous path as default. On macOS, `/var/run` is not writable without root — all Telegram HITL decisions silently timed out. Override in `gate.json`: `{ "telegram": { "inbox_dir": "/path/to/inbox" } }`.
- **"RFC 8693-style" claim removed.** `chain.mjs` header comment and all code references to "RFC 8693-style" or "RFC 8693 inspired" removed. The delegation chain is a custom Ed25519-signed structure — accurate description matters when presenting to Forrester and NCCoE evaluators who check standards claims.

### Tests

- 2 new integration tests: `tampered chain: daemon rejects forged chain → deny`, `attacker-supplied bare array: daemon rejects unverifiable chain → deny`
- Total Phase 2 tests: 129 (was 127). Grand total: 360.

## 2.0.0-alpha — 2026-03-29

Phase 2 begins. Gate daemon — first piece of the SDK governance membrane.

### Added

- **SDK Gate Daemon** (`sdk/daemon/daemon.mjs`, `bin/zlar-daemon`). Persistent Node.js Unix domain socket server replacing the fork-per-call subprocess model. Eliminates macOS fork+exec overhead (0.3–5ms per call). JSON-RPC 2.0 over 4-byte length-prefixed frames. Socket mode 0600 (owner-only). `getpeereid()` for kernel-verified peer identity. Socket discovery: `ZLAR_GATE_SOCKET` env var → `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zlar/gate.sock` → `~/.zlar/gate.sock`.
- **Full policy parity.** Daemon implements identical logic to bash gate: DETAIL Schema Contract (same frozen schemas per domain), `matchDetailField()` (regex/contains/prefix/eq/not_regex), compound_guard AND-constraints, first-match-wins evaluation, default deny.
- **Shared infrastructure.** Reads same `etc/gate.json`, `etc/policies/active.policy.json`, `var/log/zlar-oc/audit.jsonl`, `etc/standing-approvals.json`, `var/log/approvals/` pending files. Approval binding hashes identical to bash gate: `SHA-256(rule|toolName|sortedJSON(detail))`. Policy signature verified at startup via jq subprocess (bit-exact compatibility). Per-entry Ed25519 audit signing with hash chain.
- **Blocking HITL.** Telegram ask blocks daemon connection while human decides (rather than deny-then-retry). Polling same `var/run/zlar-tg/inbox/cc/` inbox. Deny-then-retry still supported for clients that call evaluate multiple times.
- **Fail-closed everywhere.** Policy missing → deny. Daemon unavailable → client denies. Timeout → deny. Crash → deny. SIGPIPE suppressed.
- **53 new tests.** Tool translation (19 cases), detail field matching (11 cases), policy evaluation (10 cases), approval binding hash (4 cases), JSON-RPC 2.0 framing (5 cases), policy signature format (3 cases), live socket integration (conditional on running daemon). `node test.mjs` in `sdk/daemon/`.

### Architecture note

Phase 1 (bash gate, CC hook, MCP gate) unchanged. Daemon is new infrastructure for Phase 2 SDK clients. Agents built with the Phase 2 SDK will connect to the daemon at instantiation — governance present at construction, not bolted on.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-03-29

Perimeter closure complete. Three phases closing the gap between the gate's material (sound) and the gate's coverage (not yet complete when this work began).

### Added

- **macOS Seatbelt sandboxing (Phase C).** Two per-command sandbox profiles via sandbox-exec. Tier 2a (nonet): deny all network + deny dangerous binaries (curl, wget, ssh, osascript, security) + deny secret reads + deny governance writes. Tier 2b (net): same restrictions, allows outbound network for approved commands. Gate integration via updatedInput hook protocol -- commands wrapped transparently.
- **15 new policy rules (Phase A).** R005B-H (bash): claude -p spawning, interpreter one-liners, base64 pipe, pipe-to-shell, eval/exec, .mcp.json, Docker socket, library injection. R032F/F2, R032G (write): CLAUDE.md + .mcp.json protection. R041F/F2, R041G (edit): matching edit rules. R051: .env reads upgraded from log to ask.
- **Path sanitization (Phase B).** `sanitize_path()` strips newlines and resolves symlinks via realpath before pattern matching. Prevents newline injection and symlink laundering across Write, Edit, Read, NotebookEdit domains.
- **Audit signing canonicalization.** `jq -S` key-sorting before SHA-256 hashing produces deterministic signatures within the jq toolchain. External verifiers must also use `jq -S -c` — `jq` is not a formal cross-language canonicalization standard (JCS/RFC 8785).
- **85 new tests.** `test-perimeter-closure.sh` covers all new rules, path sanitization, symlink resolution, and 10 sandbox-specific tests. 231 total across 8 suites.

### Changed

- Policy v2.6.0 (72 rules, was 57). Signed with Ed25519.
- Origin story revised to honest version: "the gate is absolute where it stands, the perimeter is not yet complete."
- Glossary: 16 new terms (Composition Attack, Governance Perimeter, Escape Hatch, Binding Width, TOCTOU Window, Approval Receipt, Tiered Sandboxing, Taint Label, Taint Explosion, Forward-Secure Signing, External Anchoring, JCS Canonicalization, Policy Transparency Log, Fencing Token, Multi-Gate Deployment, Canary System) + 5 existing terms updated.

### Honest Boundaries

17 escape hatches blocked. 2 partially (DNS exfiltration, persistence edges). 4 require upstream Anthropic fixes (#25000, #23983, #37210, MCP sampling). 2 fundamental (model deliberate evasion, kernel-level bypass).

## 1.5.0 — 2026-03-29

Perimeter closure Phase A. Policy rules only.

### Added

- 15 new policy rules mitigating 8 escape hatches (see v1.6.0 for full list)
- `test-perimeter-closure.sh` with 69 assertions

## 1.4.1 — 2026-03-26

Security fixes from cross-model audit (Codex + Claude verification). Five issues found, five fixed. The most critical: approval for one command could authorize a different command matching the same policy rule.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Approval replay/binding bypass.** Approvals were keyed only by rule + session, not by action content. An agent could get approval for `git status` (rule R014) and use that approval to execute `git push` (also R014) on retry. Approvals are now bound to a SHA-256 hash of the exact command. Mismatch forces a fresh human ask. Backward compatible with legacy pending files.
- **CRITICAL: MCP gate fail-open on missing policy.** The MCP gate returned `ask` (risk 50) when no policy file was found. Now returns `deny` (risk 100) — fail-closed, matching the bash gate's behavior.
- **MCP gate inbox forgery.** Callback files in the MCP inbox were accepted without HMAC verification. Now verified using `timingSafeEqual` with the shared dispatcher HMAC secret.
- **MCP dispatcher `mcp:` routing.** Telegram callbacks with `mcp:` prefix were silently discarded. Now routed to `/var/run/zlar-tg/inbox/mcp` with 🔷 emoji.
- **HMAC timing side-channel.** String equality comparison replaced with double-hash constant-time compare in `lib/hmac.sh`.

### Added

- **Hash chain atomicity.** `emit_event` now acquires `flock` on Linux before reading `prev_hash` and appending. Prevents chain forks under concurrent SubagentStart + PreToolUse invocations. macOS uses synchronous hook guarantee (no flock available).
- **Strict signed audit mode.** Set `ZLAR_REQUIRE_SIGNED_AUDIT=true` (env var or `gate.json`) to refuse writing unsigned audit entries. When enabled, missing signing key causes gate to deny all actions. Default: false (preserve graceful degradation).
- **Approval binding test suite** (`tests/test-approval-binding.sh`) — 11 assertions covering replay prevention, backward compatibility, hash determinism, and subagent binding.
- **MCP fail-closed test** — verifies deny on missing policy file.
- **MCP gate EXPERIMENTAL label** — startup warning that Ed25519 policy signature verification and per-entry audit signing are not yet implemented.

### Known limitations (Phase B, deferred)

- MCP gate does not verify Ed25519 policy signatures (trusts the file).
- MCP gate does not sign individual audit entries.
- These require porting the crypto abstraction to Node.js.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-03-26

Per-entry cryptographic signing and supply chain hardening. Every audit trail entry is now individually signed. The gate hardens against the deny-path bypass class and supply chain attacks.

### Added

- **Per-entry Ed25519 audit signing** — every audit entry is SHA-256 hashed and Ed25519-signed via `lib/crypto.sh` before being written to the JSONL audit trail. `signature` field appended to each entry. Graceful fallback to `"unsigned"` if signing key is missing. Satisfies SP 800-53 AU-10 (Non-Repudiation) — each entry is cryptographically bound to the signing key, providing independent verifiability.
- **R099 canary rule** — denies commands containing `ZLAR_CANARY_PROBE` to prove gate enforcement on demand. Canary test script: `scripts/canary.sh`.
- **Token rotation documentation** (`docs/token-rotation.md`) — rotation procedures for all 4 credential types (Telegram token, HMAC secret, signing keys, full reset).
- **Inbox HMAC verification** — Telegram callback files are HMAC-verified before the gate reads them. Prevents inbox file injection.
- **HMAC test suite** (`tests/test-inbox-hmac.sh`) — tests for inbox integrity verification.

### Changed

- **Deny-then-retry pattern** — replaced blocking Telegram poll with immediate deny + inbox check on retry. Claude Code hooks must respond fast — long-running polls silently bypass governance. New functions: `check_pending_approval()`, `telegram_ask_async()`. Old blocking `telegram_ask()` removed.
- **Supply chain hardening** (12 items) — SHA-pinned CI actions, vendored `cedar-wasm`, eliminated policy cache bypass seam, hidden bot token from `ps` output, hardened `/tmp` paths, locked signing algorithm to allowlist, `chmod 640` on dispatcher callback files.
- **SubagentStart handler** — now uses same deny-then-retry pattern as PreToolUse.

### Fixed

- **Silent governance bypass under `set -u`** — dead `policy_hash`/`cache_file` references crashed the gate, causing Claude Code to default-allow every policy-evaluated tool call.
- **Dispatcher file permissions** — `chmod 600` → `640` so the gate (running as user, not root) can read Telegram callback files.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-03-22

Cryptographic agility and the proof layer. The gate can now sign with post-quantum algorithms and produce machine-readable governance attestations for external consumption.

### Added

- **Cryptographic abstraction layer** (`lib/crypto.sh`) — algorithm-agnostic signing, verification, and key management. Three modes: `ed25519` (default), `ml-dsa-44` (NIST FIPS 204, post-quantum), `hybrid` (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-44 composite, both must verify). Algorithm choice is configuration via `ZLAR_SIGN_ALGORITHM` env var or `etc/crypto.json` — no code changes required. Satisfies Government of Canada cryptographic agility requirements (ITSAP.40.018). 46 tests.
- **Governance attestation** (`zlar-audit attest`) — the proof layer. Self-contained, cryptographically sealed JSON bundle packaging audit events, hash chain integrity verification, summary statistics, policy metadata, and cryptographic metadata. Designed for external consumption by regulators (OSFI E-23), insurers (AI governance coverage), courts (litigation defense), and auditors (ISO 42001).
- **E-23 Cedar policy templates** (`cedar-poc/e23.cedar`, `cedar-poc/e23.cedarschema`) — 11 rules implementing OSFI Guideline E-23 risk-tiered governance using bank risk management vocabulary: kill switches (session denial burst circuit breaker, low-confidence production halt), position limits ($10K tier-1, $100K absolute, mandatory counterparty), pre-execution checks (tiered risk thresholds by agent classification), environment controls, and third-party model controls. 25 tests.

### Changed

- **Gate and policy CLI now route through `lib/crypto.sh`** — `bin/zlar-gate` and `bin/zlar-policy` both source the cryptographic abstraction. Policy signing and verification use algorithm labels from the abstraction layer. Existing Ed25519-signed policies verify without modification (backward compatible).
- **Gate audit metadata resolved via abstraction** — `SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM`, `HASH_ALGORITHM`, and `PUBLIC_KEY_ID` are now computed by `lib/crypto.sh` rather than hardcoded.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-03-21

Agent inventory and cryptographic agility. You cannot govern what you cannot see.

### Added

- **Agent registry** (`bin/zlar-registry`) — reads the evidence trail, surfaces every agent the gate has seen: identity, sessions, activity, denial rates, domains touched. Supports multi-audit trails. Closes the agent inventory gap.
- **PQC metadata** — every audit entry now carries `signature_algorithm`, `hash_algorithm`, and `public_key_id`. Zero behavior change, but migration tooling will know exactly which entries need re-signing when Ed25519 gives way to ML-DSA.
- **Cedar proof-of-concept** (`cedar-poc/`) — three real gate rules (R012, R001, R014) translated to Cedar policy language, validated against schema, 14/14 tests passing. Proves the migration path from bash pattern matching to formal policy evaluation.
- **Demo script** (`docs/demo-script.md`) — 5-minute deny path walkthrough for briefings.

### Fixed

- **Human deny path was silently broken** — `set -e` (errexit) killed the gate process when `telegram_ask` returned exit code 1 (deny). The deny response never reached Claude Code, which defaulted to allowing the tool call. Every human deny since the gate was written was a no-op at the enforcement layer. The evidence trail recorded the deny intent but the action executed anyway. Fixed by capturing the return code safely (`telegram_ask ... || ask_result=$?`). Both PreToolUse and SubagentStart paths patched. The architecture caught the bug: recursive trust proof + evidence trail inspection revealed the gap. Approximately 29-30 historical audit entries have orphaned `pending` outcomes with no recorded resolution.

### Known limitations

- **Cedar PoC maps `ask` to `forbid`** — Cedar's effect model is binary (permit/forbid). The gate's three-valued `allow`/`deny`/`ask` requires either Cedar extensions or a two-pass evaluation. The PoC proves rule translation, not full semantic parity.
- **OC gate audit schema divergence** — the OC gate does not emit `prev_hash` or `authorizer` fields. Observation tools that query these fields will silently return null for OC events. Schema alignment planned for a future release.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-03-21

Added observation layer. The gate enforces — the witness observes. Two layers, one product.

### Added

- **Sequence detection** (`bin/zlar-witness`) — reads the evidence trail after the fact, finds multi-step behavioral patterns (credential-adjacent-egress, denied-then-scheduled, approval-drift, repeated-denial-burst)
- **Governance digest** (`bin/zlar-digest`) — weekly summary of decisions, approval latency, detected sequences. Sends to Telegram.
- **Standing authority view** (`bin/zlar-standing`) — shows what the agent can do right now without asking
- **Shared audit library** (`lib/audit-reader.sh`) — fact extraction from evidence trails. Multi-audit support: reads from both CC and OC gate trails via `ZLAR_AUDIT_FILES`
- **Sequence definitions** (`etc/sequences.json`) — pattern catalog for witness detection
- **Test suite** (`tests/test-witness.sh`) — 20+ assertions covering witness, digest, standing, and audit-reader
- **Design documentation** (`docs/witness.md`) — observation layer design philosophy

### Changed

- CI now includes ShellCheck for `lib/` and `tests/`, plus witness test execution

## 1.0.0 — 2026-03-18
