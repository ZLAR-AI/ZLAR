# Changelog

## 1.3.0 — 2026-03-22

Cryptographic agility and the proof layer. The gate can now sign with post-quantum algorithms and produce machine-readable governance attestations for external consumption.

### Added

- **Cryptographic abstraction layer** (`lib/crypto.sh`) — algorithm-agnostic signing, verification, and key management. Three modes: `ed25519` (default), `ml-dsa-44` (NIST FIPS 204, post-quantum), `hybrid` (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-44 composite, both must verify). Algorithm choice is configuration via `ZLAR_SIGN_ALGORITHM` env var or `etc/crypto.json` — no code changes required. Satisfies Government of Canada cryptographic agility requirements (ITSAP.40.018). 46 tests.
- **Governance attestation** (`zlar-audit attest`) — the proof layer. Self-contained, cryptographically sealed JSON bundle packaging audit events, hash chain integrity verification, summary statistics, policy metadata, and cryptographic metadata. Designed for external consumption by regulators (OSFI E-23), insurers (AI governance coverage), courts (litigation defense), and auditors (ISO 42001).
- **E-23 Cedar policy templates** (`cedar-poc/e23.cedar`, `cedar-poc/e23.cedarschema`) — 11 rules implementing OSFI Guideline E-23 risk-tiered governance using bank risk management vocabulary: kill switches (session denial burst circuit breaker, low-confidence production halt), position limits ($10K tier-1, $100K absolute, mandatory counterparty), pre-execution checks (tiered risk thresholds by agent classification), environment controls, and third-party model controls. 25 tests.

### Changed

- **Gate and policy CLI now route through `lib/crypto.sh`** — `bin/zlar-gate` and `bin/zlar-policy` both source the cryptographic abstraction. Policy signing and verification use algorithm labels from the abstraction layer. Existing Ed25519-signed policies verify without modification (backward compatible).
- **Gate audit metadata resolved via abstraction** — `SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM`, `HASH_ALGORITHM`, and `PUBLIC_KEY_ID` are now computed by `lib/crypto.sh` rather than hardcoded.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-03-21

Agent inventory and cryptographic agility. You cannot govern what you cannot see.

### Added

- **Agent registry** (`bin/zlar-registry`) — reads the evidence trail, surfaces every agent the gate has seen: identity, sessions, activity, denial rates, domains touched. Supports multi-audit trails. Closes the agent inventory gap.
- **PQC metadata** — every audit entry now carries `signature_algorithm`, `hash_algorithm`, and `public_key_id`. Zero behavior change, but migration tooling will know exactly which entries need re-signing when Ed25519 gives way to ML-DSA.
- **Cedar proof-of-concept** (`cedar-poc/`) — three real gate rules (R012, R001, R014) translated to Cedar policy language, validated against schema, 14/14 tests passing. Proves the migration path from bash pattern matching to formal policy evaluation.
- **Demo script** (`docs/demo-script.md`) — 5-minute deny path walkthrough for briefings.

### Fixed

- **Human deny path was silently broken** — `set -e` (errexit) killed the gate process when `telegram_ask` returned exit code 1 (deny). The deny response never reached Claude Code, which defaulted to allowing the tool call. Every human deny since the gate was written was a no-op at the enforcement layer. The evidence trail recorded the deny intent but the action executed anyway. Fixed by capturing the return code safely (`telegram_ask ... || ask_result=$?`). Both PreToolUse and SubagentStart paths patched. The architecture caught the bug: recursive trust proof + evidence trail inspection revealed the gap. Approximately 29-30 historical audit entries have orphaned `pending` outcomes with no recorded resolution.

### Known limitations

- **Cedar PoC maps `ask` to `forbid`** — Cedar's effect model is binary (permit/forbid). The gate's three-valued `allow`/`deny`/`ask` requires either Cedar extensions or a two-pass evaluation. The PoC proves rule translation, not full semantic parity.
- **OC gate audit schema divergence** — the OC gate does not emit `prev_hash` or `authorizer` fields. Observation tools that query these fields will silently return null for OC events. Schema alignment planned for a future release.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-03-21

Added observation layer. The gate enforces — the witness observes. Two layers, one product.

### Added

- **Sequence detection** (`bin/zlar-witness`) — reads the evidence trail after the fact, finds multi-step behavioral patterns (credential-adjacent-egress, denied-then-scheduled, approval-drift, repeated-denial-burst)
- **Governance digest** (`bin/zlar-digest`) — weekly summary of decisions, approval latency, detected sequences. Sends to Telegram.
- **Standing authority view** (`bin/zlar-standing`) — shows what the agent can do right now without asking
- **Shared audit library** (`lib/audit-reader.sh`) — fact extraction from evidence trails. Multi-audit support: reads from both CC and OC gate trails via `ZLAR_AUDIT_FILES`
- **Sequence definitions** (`etc/sequences.json`) — pattern catalog for witness detection
- **Test suite** (`tests/test-witness.sh`) — 20+ assertions covering witness, digest, standing, and audit-reader
- **Design documentation** (`docs/witness.md`) — observation layer design philosophy

### Changed

- CI now includes ShellCheck for `lib/` and `tests/`, plus witness test execution

## 1.0.0 — 2026-03-18
